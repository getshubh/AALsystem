# Face Recognition using Haar-Cascade Classifier, OpenCV, and Python
Simple Face Recognition algorithm using Python and OpenCV

## Requirement
- Python 3.5
- OpenCV 3.1.0
- Numpy

## Outline
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:
1. Creating datasets (face_datasets.py)
2. Train the model (training.py)
3. Face Recognition (face_recognition.py)

## Reading materials
1. Object Detection using Haar-like features, link: http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/courses/spring2008/slides/Faces_demo.pdf
2. Face Detection using Haar Cascades, link: http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html
3. Haar-like Features, link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar-like_features
4. Object Detection using Haar-cascades Classifier, link: http://ds.cs.ut.ee/Members/artjom85/2014dss-course-media/Object%20detection%20using%20Haar-final.pdf
5. OpenCV Documentation, link: http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

## Tips
- If you don't understand what the code do, I already comments it line by line. 
- You also can Google the syntax, and read the explanation from OpenCV Documentation.
- Feel free to ask me through my email: nazmiasri95@gmail.com
